            <h1>Javascript</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile and essential programming language that powers the interactive elements of the web. Developed in the mid-1990s, JavaScript allows developers to add dynamic behaviour and interactivity to websites, making it a fundamental tool for creating everything from simple animations and form validation to complex web applications. With its ability to run directly in web browsers, JavaScript has become a cornerstone of modern web development, enabling seamless user experiences and bridging the gap between static content and dynamic functionality on the internet. Its ubiquity and flexibility make JavaScript a must-know language for any aspiring web developer</p>

<div class="lang-uses">
        <div class="lang-uses-1">
        <h3>1. Web Development</h3>
        <p>JavaScript's most famous and foundational use is in web development. It is essential for creating interactive and dynamic websites. JavaScript enables features like form validation, real-time updates, interactive user interfaces, and asynchronous communication with servers. Notably, it powers many of the world's most popular websites and web applications.</p>         
        </div>
        <div class="lang-uses-2">
        <h3>2. Front-End Frameworks and Libraries</h3>
        <p>JavaScript has gained immense popularity through front-end development frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js. These frameworks allow developers to build complex, high-performance user interfaces and single-page applications (SPAs) efficiently. React, in particular, has been widely adopted and is used by companies like Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb.</p>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="lang-uses-3">
        <h3>3. Server-Side Development with Node.js</h3>
        <p>Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on the V8 JavaScript engine, has become famous for enabling server-side development using JavaScript. Node.js has revolutionized server-side programming by providing a fast and scalable environment for building web servers and real-time applications. It's used by companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, and PayPal for their back-end services.</p>
