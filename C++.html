        <h1>C++</h1>
        <p id="pros&cons">C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language known for its performance and
            flexibility.
            It emerged as an extension of the C programming language and has since become a fundamental tool in software
            development.
            C++ is widely used in various domains, including game development, system programming, and embedded systems,
            owing to its ability to combine low-level memory control with high-level abstractions.
            Its influence on the development of modern software and its role in shaping many other programming languages
            make C++ an essential language for programmers seeking to build efficient and robust applications.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Performance</span>: C++ is renowned for its efficiency and speed.
                It allows developers to have fine-grained control over memory management and hardware,
                making it suitable for resource-intensive applications like games, real-time simulations, and
                system-level programming.
            </td>
            <td><span>Complexity:</span> C++ can be quite complex, especially for beginners. Its syntax and features,
                including templates and multiple inheritance,
                can be challenging to grasp, leading to potential errors and longer development times.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Versatility:</span> C++ is a multi-paradigm language, supporting both procedural and object-oriented
                programming,
                which makes it adaptable to a wide range of application domains.
                It can be used for anything from desktop applications to embedded systems and high-performance servers.
            </td>
            <td><span>Memory Managemnt:</span> While C++ offers fine-grained control over memory,
                this also means that developers are responsible for managing memory manually. This can lead to memory
                leaks,
                segmentation faults, and other memory-related issues if not handled properly.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Rich Standard Library:</span> C++ includes a robust standard library that provides a wealth of
                functionality,
                including data structures, algorithms, and I/O operations. This library simplifies and accelerates
                development tasks.
            </td>
            <td><span>Safety Concerns:</span> C++ allows for low-level operations that can be error-prone, such as pointer
                arithmetic.
                This can lead to security vulnerabilities like buffer overflows if not managed carefully.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Compatibility:</span> C++ can interoperate with C code seamlessly,
                allowing developers to leverage existing C libraries and codebases. This makes it easier to integrate
                C++ into existing projects or transition from C to C++.
            </td>
            <td><span>Verbose Syntax:</span> C++ code can be verbose compared to some modern programming languages,
                which can make code harder to read and maintain.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Strong Community and Resources:</span> C++ has a large and active community of developers, which means
                there are abundant resources,
                tutorials, and libraries available for learning and development.
            </td>
            <td><span>Slower Development:</span> Because of its complexity and need for careful memory management,
                C++ development can be slower compared to languages with automatic memory management like Python or
                Java.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Abstraction and Encapsulation:</span> C++ supports object-oriented programming,
                enabling developers to create well-structured and modular code through concepts like classes and
                objects.
                This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
            </td>
            <td><span>Platform-Dependent Code:</span> Code written in C++ may not always be easily portable across different
                platforms or compilers,
                which can be a concern for projects requiring cross-platform compatibility.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Low-Level Control:</span> C++ provides direct access to memory and hardware,
                allowing developers to optimise code for specific performance requirements, making it suitable for
                systems programming.
            </td>
            <td><span>Limited Standard Library for Certain Tasks:</span> While C++ has a rich standard library,
                it may lack certain modern features and abstractions found in languages designed for specific domains
                (e.g., web development, data analysis).
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>Portability:</span> C++ compilers are available on various platforms,
                ensuring that code written in C++ can be executed on different operating systems without major
                modifications.
            </td>
            <td><span>Difficulty in Learning:</span> Learning C++ can be challenging, especially for those new to programming.
                Its complexity and the need to understand memory management concepts can be intimidating for beginners.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span id="function">Strong Typing:</span> C++ enforces strong typing,
                reducing the chances of runtime errors and enhancing code reliability.
            </td>
            <td><span>Lack of Built-in Concurrency Support:</span> C++ lacks built-in support for high-level concurrency
                constructs
                like those found in languages such as Python and Java. Concurrency management often requires the use of
                external libraries or manual threading,
                which can be error-prone.
